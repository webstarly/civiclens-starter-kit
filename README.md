# LiteracyForge Starter Kit

Welcome to the **LiteracyForge Starter Kit** 🎉
This kit will help you participate in the [LiteracyForge quest](https://app.lunor.quest/challenge/1000038) on the **Lunor Quest** platform.

In this challenge, you will:

* Read short English passages
* Answer multiple-choice questions about them
* Evaluate the difficulty and quality of the questions and answers

Your contributions will directly support the development of **AI-powered literacy tools** that adapt to learners’ needs.



## 📂 What’s Inside

* `info.txt` → A template file you must fill out and submit on Lunor Quest after completing tasks on Prodi.gy.
* `README.md` → Instructions (this file).

3. **Start Annotating**

4. **Complete Tasks**

   * Read the passages.
   * Answer the multiple-choice questions.
   * Evaluate text and question difficulty + overall quality.

5. **Fill in `info.txt`**

   ⚠️ **Important:** Submitting `info.txt` on Lunor Quest is required for your participation to count.
   If you skip this step, your work on Prodi.gy will not be registered.



## 📜 Submission Requirements

* Submit the completed `info.txt` on the **Lunor Quest** platform.
* We only collect **generic and non-PII info** to provide context to your annotations.
* This context makes your contributions more valuable by linking responses with background factors (e.g., English proficiency, demographics).



## 🎯 Rewards

* **Prize Pool:** \$10,000 USD
* Rewards are distributed **linearly** based on the score of your valid submissions:

```
Your Reward = (Your Score ÷ Sum of All Scores) × Total Prize Pool
```

👉 Example: If total scores = 10,000 and your score = 500 → your reward = \$500.



## ✅ Rules

* Only **human answers** and evaluations are valid.
* Use of LLMs, bots, or automated scripts will result in disqualification.
* Submit as many valid annotations as you like — the more you contribute, the higher your score.
